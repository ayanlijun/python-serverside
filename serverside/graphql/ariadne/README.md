# Ariade Database Helpers

Text

## Databases supported by Django

For databases' supported by Django, we have made helper functions for 5
basic crud operations for a Django model:

1. Get a record
2. Get records
3. Create a record
4. Update a record
5. Delete a record

These helper functions are in `django_models`, naturally.

## DynamoDB models

We want to do the same for DynamoDB, using the awesome PynamoDB package

## MongoDB / Cassandra

Will do these sometime in the future
